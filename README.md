# PlantPro
 Plant pro website using Laravel and Vue.js.
 
# Installation
 
 In order to install and run this website, you need to have the following installed:
 * PHP with composer
 * MySQL
 * Laravel
 * Some sort of web server (you can use the default Laravel web server for testing purposes)
 
 
 In order to set up laravel, I recommend visiting [the installation section of the Laravel website](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/installation). I also recommend running a virtual machine with Homestead and vagrant so you don't have to install all of this stuff on your regular machine. Laravel's tutorial on setting up Homestead can be found [here](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/homestead).
